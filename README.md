My website is a content management system. The first page you load into will be called index.php, it is the public view of the page. When you
are first laoded in there will be no content either then the header from which you can select which page you would like to view. The page is called by the 'page_id' in 
my database from that point you can log in if you are adminastrator already or create an account if you do not have one. Once logged in you can add, edit, delete users, add, edit, and delete 
web pages that the public will see and you can change the logofor the website as well.

As the extra steps to my project, i added a section in the appPage.php file in which users can change the background-color of their page as well as the font-color.
